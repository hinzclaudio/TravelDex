# TravelDex

## Introduction
TravelDex is an application I wrote to demonstrate my current programming skills. At the same time I tried to - and will continue to - build something that is of worth to other people. 

What is TravelDex exactly? TravelDex aims to help you with remembering your beloved trips around the world. The app allows you to add locations to trips, comment on any locations you have visited and even enables you to see everything you have done so far on a map.

## Architecture
For the most part, TravelDex is powered by CoreData, RxSwift and UIKit. TravelDex is based on the MVVM-Coordinator pattern. There is a wide variety of Unit Tests present in the project - they can serve you as a better documentation of the architecture.
